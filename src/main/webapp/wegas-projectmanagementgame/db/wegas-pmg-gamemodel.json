The analysis has however shown that a type of milling machine cannot currently handle this system. It will be necessary to integrate this restriction during development. This would have at any rate been detected during implanting on the machines, but corrections would have then proved more difficult.<br />The analysis also shows that the development costs should be estimated 20% higher than the initial estimation of the project.",
