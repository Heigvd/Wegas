    Returns an array of route objects that match the specified URL path.

    This method is called internally to determine which routes match the current
    path whenever the URL changes. You may override it if you want to customize
    the route matching logic, although this usually shouldn't be necessary.

    Each returned route object has the following properties:

      * `callback`: A function or a string representing the name of a function
        this router that should be executed when the route is triggered.

      * `keys`: An array of strings representing the named parameters defined in
        the route's path specification, if any.

      * `path`: The route's path specification, which may be either a string or
        a regex.

      * `regex`: A regular expression version of the route's path specification.
        This regex is used to determine whether the route matches a given path.

    @example
        router.route('/foo', function () {});
        router.match('/foo');
        // => [{callback: ..., keys: [], path: '/foo', regex: ...}]

    The specified URL must share the same origin (i.e., protocol, host, and

    /**
    Adds a route handler for the specified URL _path_.

    The _path_ parameter may be either a string or a regular expression. If it's
    a string, it may contain named parameters: `:param` will match any single
    part of a URL path (not including `/` characters), and `*param` will match
    any number of parts of a URL path (including `/` characters). These named
    parameters will be made available as keys on the `req.params` object that's
    passed to route handlers.

    If the _path_ parameter is a regex, all pattern matches will be made
    available as numbered keys on `req.params`, starting with `0` for the full
    match, then `1` for the first subpattern match, and so on.

    Here's a set of sample routes along with URL paths that they match:

      * Route: `/photos/:tag/:page`
        * URL: `/photos/kittens/1`, params: `{tag: 'kittens', page: '1'}`
        * URL: `/photos/puppies/2`, params: `{tag: 'puppies', page: '2'}`

      * Route: `/file/*path`
        * URL: `/file/foo/bar/baz.txt`, params: `{path: 'foo/bar/baz.txt'}`
        * URL: `/file/foo`, params: `{path: 'foo'}`

    **Middleware**: Routes also support an arbitrary number of callback
    functions. This allows you to easily reuse parts of your route-handling code
    with different route. This method is liberal in how it processes the
    specified `callbacks`, you can specify them as separate arguments, or as
    arrays, or both.

    If multiple route match a given URL, they will be executed in the order they
    were added. The first route that was added will be the first to be executed.

    **Passing Control**: Invoking the `next()` function within a route callback
    will pass control to the next callback function (if any) or route handler
    (if any). If a value is passed to `next()`, it's assumed to be an error,
    therefore stopping the dispatch chain, unless that value is: `"route"`,
    which is special case and dispatching will skip to the next route handler.
    This allows middleware to skip any remaining middleware for a particular
    route.

    @example
        router.route('/photos/:tag/:page', function (req, res, next) {
        });

        // Using middleware.

        router.findUser = function (req, res, next) {
            req.user = this.get('users').findById(req.params.user);
            next();
        };

        router.route('/users/:user', 'findUser', function (req, res, next) {
            // The `findUser` middleware puts the `user` object on the `req`.
        });

    @method route
    @param {String|RegExp} path Path to match. May be a string or a regular
      expression.
    @param {Array|Function|String} callbacks* Callback functions to call
        whenever this route is triggered. These can be specified as separate
        arguments, or in arrays, or both. If a callback is specified as a
        string, the named function will be called on this router instance.

      @param {Object} callbacks.req Request object containing information about
          the request. It contains the following properties.

        @param {Array|Object} callbacks.req.params Captured parameters matched by
          the route path specification. If a string path was used and contained
          named parameters, then this will be a key/value hash mapping parameter
          names to their matched values. If a regex path was used, this will be
          an array of subpattern matches starting at index 0 for the full match,
          then 1 for the first subpattern match, and so on.
        @param {String} callbacks.req.path The current URL path.
        @param {Number} callbacks.req.pendingCallbacks Number of remaining
          callbacks the route handler has after this one in the dispatch chain.
        @param {Number} callbacks.req.pendingRoutes Number of matching routes
          after this one in the dispatch chain.
        @param {Object} callbacks.req.query Query hash representing the URL
          query string, if any. Parameter names are keys, and are mapped to
          parameter values.
        @param {String} callbacks.req.url The full URL.
        @param {String} callbacks.req.src What initiated the dispatch. In an
          HTML5 browser, when the back/forward buttons are used, this property
          will have a value of "popstate".

      @param {Object} callbacks.res Response object containing methods and
          information that relate to responding to a request. It contains the
          following properties.
        @param {Object} callbacks.res.req Reference to the request object.

      @param {Function} callbacks.next Function to pass control to the next
          callback or the next matching route if no more callbacks (middleware)
          exist for the current route handler. If you don't call this function,
          then no further callbacks or route handlers will be executed, even if
          there are more that match. If you do call this function, then the next
          callback (if any) or matching route handler (if any) will be called.
          All of these functions will receive the same `req` and `res` objects
          that were passed to this route (so you can use these objects to pass
          data along to subsequent callbacks and routes).
        @param {String} [callbacks.next.err] Optional error which will stop the
          dispatch chaining for this `req`, unless the value is `"route"`, which
          is special cased to jump skip past any callbacks for the current route
          and pass control the next route handler.
